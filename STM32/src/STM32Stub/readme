Stub for STM32 based boards.
This allow to install tools and use STM32 cores repositories.
To do this:
1 - create a "STM" directory to {Arduino path}/hardware/
2 - clone the core repo to this directory. ex:
git clone https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32F1.git STM32F1

At this step you could build sketch for the board selected.
In order to be able to upload the board, it is required to clone the 
"Arduino_Tools" repo to this directory:
{local Arduino path}/packages/STM32/tools/STM32Tools/1.0

git clone https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Tools.git tools
